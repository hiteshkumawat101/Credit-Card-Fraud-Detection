Aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using ML algorithms. The model is trained on a dataset of credit card transactions and predicts whether a transaction is fraud or not.

The data suggests that certain features have distinct mean values for fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions. These differences can be leveraged by the logistic regression model to predict the likelihood of a transaction being fraudulent. Features with larger differences in means between the two classes are likely to be more influential in the modelâ€™s predictions.
